Was working on a project, when I asked AI to "redo" a process model or a Sequence Diagram

For deciding what development methodology to use for a product(security vs availability):
![Desktop-vs-WebDev]([https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/552e678d-f956-4786-a20a-422204511546](https://github.com/StevenMunich/AI-Fraud/blob/main/Typo-in-chart.png?raw=true))

Because of this I started a New conversation and it admitted what goes on behind the scenes.
![Desktop-vs-WebDev]([[https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/552e678d-f956-4786-a20a-422204511546](https://github.com/StevenMunich/AI-Fraud/blob/main/Typo-in-chart.png?raw=true)](https://github.com/StevenMunich/AI-Fraud/blob/main/Automation-Requires-Supervision.png?raw=true))

So, AI is not really AI. 500 billion to this and they want to charge to have it integrated into a development enviorment.
