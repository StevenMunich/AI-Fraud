Was working on a project, when I asked AI to "redo" a process model or a Sequence Diagram

For deciding what development methodology to use for a product(security vs availability):

Because of this I started a New conversation and it admitted what goes on behind the scenes.

So, AI is not really AI. 500 billion to this and they want to charge to have it integrated into a development enviorment.

Every time you use "AI" LOOK FOR TYPOS.

I have had a response that told me to install a python lib named "reqwest" instead of "request" and python libraries CAN HAVE BAD STUFF if not careful.

PS: years ago code it "generated" was scraped from Geeks4Geeks, same vairable names and even comments sometimes. Many responses are pre-determined.
